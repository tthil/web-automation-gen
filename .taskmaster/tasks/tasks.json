Central State Management System (`state-manager.js`)\n- Created a comprehensive state management system with event subscription capabilities\n- Implemented state persistence using localStorage for UI preferences\n- Added support for different app modes: idle, recording, replaying\n- Included session management, filtering, and category handling\n- Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms\n\n### 2. Component Integration (`component-integration.js`)\n- Connected all existing UI components to the central state manager\n- Implemented event handlers for all user interactions\n- Added state-aware UI updates and transitions\n- Integrated with existing toast and screen reader systems\n- Provided seamless coordination between components\n\n### 3. Enhanced Styling (`state-management.css`)\n- Added visual states for session selection and app modes\n- Implemented smooth transitions and animations\n- Enhanced accessibility with focus states and high contrast support\n- Added responsive design considerations\n- Included loading and error state styling\n\n### 4. Integration Testing (`state-integration-test.js`)\n- Created automated tests to verify state management functionality\n- Tests cover initialization, subscription system, persistence, and component integration\n- Visual test results indicator for immediate feedback\n\n### 5. Key Features Implemented:\n- Central state management for tracking application state (idle, recording, replaying)\n- UI component integration with state-aware updates\n- Event handlers for all user interactions\n- Local storage persistence for UI preferences and session state\n- Session selection, filtering, and category management\n- Placeholder functions for backend API integration\n- Error handling and recovery mechanisms\n- Accessibility enhancements\n- Responsive design support\n\n### 6. Technical Implementation:\n- Used module pattern for encapsulation and namespace management\n- Implemented observer pattern for state change notifications\n- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms\n- Integrated with existing codebase without breaking changes\n- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality\n</info added on 2025-08-04T22:26:59.055Z>",
